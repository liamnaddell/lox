1. trying to create a AST node store is awful because you can't just hand out ptrs and references like c++
2. trying to create an AST node store is awful because you can't just store pointers
3. dealing with nodeid's is horrible because no OO
4. AI generate your ::new() functions!
5. Probably the worst of all is the lack of reference splitting on structs. There's no way to borrow part of a struct. This makes an entire class of correct code incorrect, and forces people to redesign their structs to being smaller, even when it's inappropriate!
